Q1: Page 0 is the process's codes and data. Page 2 is user stack. The process cannot read/write the memory mapped by page 1, because page 1 is guard page.
Q2: The condition here is mainly to carry out overflow detection, to prevent uncharacterized integer overflow. when srcve is smaller than p->sz but len is an enormous number, such as 0xffff...ffff (which corresponds to -1), because of the uncharacterized integer flooding, it is possible to satisfy the conditions of Srcva+len <p- >sz, but a large amount of memory is actually replicated. However, it is possible to detect a spill by using the criterion srcva+len < srcba.
